# Release Notes: v0.0.1-beta.2

This release introduces the **Ollama Models Hub**, a significant new feature allowing users to manage local models directly from the web interface. It also includes important fixes and improvements.

---

#### ✨ New Features

*   **Ollama Models Hub (`/models`)**
    *   A new page has been added to view, pull, and delete local Ollama models without needing to use the command line.
    *   **View Local Models:** See a list of all downloaded models, their size, and when they were last modified.
    *   **Pull New Models:** Enter a model name (e.g., `llama3:8b`) to download it from the Ollama library. The UI provides real-time streaming feedback and a progress bar during the download.
    *   **Delete Models:** Easily remove models you no longer need to free up disk space.
    *   Backend support was added with new API endpoints (`/api/models`, `/api/models/pull`, `/api/models/delete`) to interact with the Ollama service.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Corrected GGUF Model Path:** The `install.sh` script was updated to use the correct Hugging Face model path (`unsloth/gpt-oss-7b-gguf:q4_k_m`), resolving a "model not found" error during setup.
*   **Model Deletion API:** The `/api/models/delete` endpoint in `app.py` was improved to correctly handle empty responses from the Ollama API upon successful deletion, preventing a potential frontend error.

#### ⚙️ Improvements

*   **Simplified Feature Request Template:** The GitHub issue template for feature requests (`20_feature_request.yml`) has been streamlined to make it quicker and easier for users to submit new ideas.

# Release Notes: v0.0.1-beta.4

This release introduces major new functionality, including web search capabilities via SearXNG and a more robust file upload system that now supports PDFs. It also includes several backend improvements for a more stable and intuitive user experience.

---

### ✨ New Features

*   **Web Search with SearXNG**:

    *   The search results are automatically provided as context to the LLM, enabling it to answer questions with up-to-date information.
    *   SearXNG can be enabled and configured from the `/settings` page.

---

#### 📝 Known Issues & Future Work
*   Response regeneration is still limited to the most recent message in the conversation.
*   UI/UX refinements are ongoing.


# Release Notes: v0.0.1-beta.5

This release introduces the **Prompt Hub**, a major new feature for creating, managing, and reusing prompts directly within the application. It also includes several important documentation updates and backend improvements to enhance usability and maintainability.

---

### ✨ New Features

*   **Prompt Hub (`/prompts`)**
    *   A new page has been added to create, view, edit, and delete reusable prompts.
    *   **Create & Manage Prompts:** A user-friendly modal allows for the creation and editing of prompts with a title, type (e.g., "Code," "Creative"), and content.
    *   **Use Prompts in Chat:** On the main chat page, a new "Select a Prompt" dropdown lets users instantly load a saved prompt's content as a system message for the current conversation, streamlining repetitive tasks.
    *   Backend support was added with new API endpoints (`/api/prompts`, `/api/prompts/create`, `/api/prompts/update/<id>`, `/api/prompts/delete/<id>`) to manage prompts in the SQLite database.
    *   **Web Search with SearXNG**: Trigger a search from the chat input by clicking the 🔍 icon or typing `/search <your query>` (e.g., `/search latest AI news`).
### ⚙️ Improvements & Fixes

*   **File Upload Logic**:
    *   The file upload mechanism in `app.py` has been refactored. It now correctly saves the file content as a "system" message to the active database (SQLite or ChromaDB) before the user sends their first message, ensuring the context is available for the entire conversation.
    *   The logic for prepending file context to the user's prompt has been made more robust.
*   **Documentation Overhaul**:
    *   The `readme.md` and `documentation.md` files have been updated to reflect the latest features, including the new Prompt Hub and improved file upload functionality.
    *   Installation and setup instructions have been clarified.
*   **Code Cleanup**:
    *   Removed the unused `ThreadManager` class, as session management is now handled by the Flask session, simplifying the codebase.
    *   The `system_prompt` column has been removed from the `settings` table schema in `app.py` as it is now managed via the Prompt Hub.

---

#### 📝 Known Issues & Future Work

*   Response regeneration is still limited to the most recent message in the conversation.
*   UI/UX refinements for the new Prompt Hub are ongoing.

### Release Notes: v0.0.1-beta.10

This release focuses on improving user experience and state management. Key features include a new history sidebar for quick navigation, session management via URL parameters, and the ability to toggle the visibility of models in the chat interface.


#### ✨ Features

*   **History Sidebar**: A new collapsible sidebar has been added to the main chat page. It displays a list of recent chat sessions, allowing users to quickly switch between conversations.
*   **Session Management in URL**: Chat sessions are now managed via a `session_id` in the URL (e.g., `/?session_id=...`). This allows for bookmarking, sharing, and resuming specific conversations.
*   **Model Activity Toggle**: Both local Ollama models and configured cloud models can now be individually enabled or disabled from the UI (`/models` and `/cloud_models` pages) without being deleted. This provides better control over which models appear in the selection dropdown on the chat page.
